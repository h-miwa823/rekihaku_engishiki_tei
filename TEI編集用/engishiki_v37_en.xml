						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010001">This ritual was
							held on the first three days of the new year according to the
							traditional East Asian lunisolar calendar. Here it is called "*ganjitsu
							no mikusuri</seg>," but it appears under slightly different names in other
							sources. In *Gishiki</seg> 儀式, for instance, it is called "*mikusuri wo
							kūzuru gi</seg> 供御薬儀." It originates in China and can be seen in numerous
							almanacs of seasonal events.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010101">As a rule, names
							of compounded medications have been left untranslated except for those
							elements that can be discerned (personal names, number of ingredients,
							other numerical elements; see next note for an example). *Byakusan</seg>,
							which literally means "white powder," has been left untranslated as it
							is used as a proper noun, whereas a literal English translation would
							suggest an overly generic-sounding name. *Doshōsan</seg> is also a powdered
							medication.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010102">*Byakusan</seg> and
							*doshōsan</seg> are concoctions of various medicinal herbs traditionally
							consumed on New Year's Day with *toso</seg>, a mix of medicinal herbs and
							spices steeped in *sake</seg>.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010103">The "ointment for
							a thousand poxes and ten-thousand maladies" (*sensō manbyō kō</seg>) first
							appears as part of this rite in the *Engi shiki</seg> and its ingredients
							are unknown; it was not part of the New Year's celebrations in China.
							According to *Saikyūki</seg> 西宮記, a compendium on court ceremonial compiled
							in the tenth century by Minamoto no Takaakira 源高明 (914-983), it was
							offered to the *tennō</seg> on the third day and applied to his hands. See
							Maruyama, "Mikusuri wo kūzuru gi no seiritsu", pp. 153-4.</note>

							the Office of the Brewery, or *Miki no tsukasa</seg> 造酒司; see below). In the
							*Wamyō ruiju shō</seg> (scroll 4 of the ten-scroll version), it appears in a
							section named "*kikugetsu</seg> 麹蘗," namely *kōji</seg> mold and *moyashi</seg>;
							this shows that these two substances were related but distinct. The
							Chinese character 糵 is glossed "*yone no moyashi</seg> 与禰乃毛夜之" in this text,
							where *yone</seg> means rice. The translation adopted here ("germinated
							rice") is based on this passage, but can also confirmed in other
							tenth-century sources. For instance, in the *Honzō wamyō</seg> 本草和名, we see
							that the compound 孽米, in which the character for *moyashi</seg> precedes the
							character for rice, is simply glossed "*moyashi</seg> 毛也之." In scroll 30 of
							*Ishinpō</seg> 医心方, we found the compound 孽米 glossed "*ine no moyashi</seg>
							以禰乃毛也之where *ine</seg>, again, means rice (more specifically, the rice
							plant). These passages imply that the rice used here is not white rice
							(i.e., rice that had the germ removed), as, otherwise, there could be no
							germination. </note>

						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710980202">Provinces in the
							Saikaidō did not submit tax payments directly to the capital; instead,
							these were sent to Dazaifu and used to sustain its operations. For this
							reason, there were no envoys in charge of carrying tributes presented as
							tax-in-kind from the Saikaidō provinces to the capital. Dazaifu's
							provisions for the Bureau of Medications were, therefore, entrusted to
							envoys in charge of transporting additional tribute (*bekkō/* 別貢), a
							form of tax imposed on all provinces (including Dazaifu) except the five
							Kinai provinces and Shima, to the capital.</note>
