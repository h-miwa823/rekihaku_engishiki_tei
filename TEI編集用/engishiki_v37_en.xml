						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010001">This ritual was
							held on the first three days of the new year according to the
							traditional East Asian lunisolar calendar. Here it is called "*ganjitsu
							no mikusuri/*," but it appears under slightly different names in other
							sources. In *Gishiki/* 儀式, for instance, it is called "*mikusuri wo
							kūzuru gi/* 供御薬儀." It originates in China and can be seen in numerous
							almanacs of seasonal events.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010101">As a rule, names
							of compounded medications have been left untranslated except for those
							elements that can be discerned (personal names, number of ingredients,
							other numerical elements; see next note for an example). *Byakusan/*,
							which literally means "white powder," has been left untranslated as it
							is used as a proper noun, whereas a literal English translation would
							suggest an overly generic-sounding name. *Doshōsan/* is also a powdered
							medication.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010102">*Byakusan/* and
							*doshōsan/* are concoctions of various medicinal herbs traditionally
							consumed on New Year's Day with *toso/*, a mix of medicinal herbs and
							spices steeped in *sake/*.</note>
						<note type="translatorsNotes" target="#footnote3710010103">The "ointment for
							a thousand poxes and ten-thousand maladies" (*sensō manbyō kō/*) first
							appears as part of this rite in the *Engi shiki/* and its ingredients
							are unknown; it was not part of the New Year's celebrations in China.
							According to *Saikyūki/* 西宮記, a compendium on court ceremonial compiled
							in the tenth century by Minamoto no Takaakira 源高明 (914-983), it was
							offered to the *tennō/* on the third day and applied to his hands. See
							Maruyama, "Mikusuri wo kūzuru gi no seiritsu", pp. 153-4.</note>
